# Realtime Markdown Editor

An improved version of the tutorial I followed, New features like Toolbar, User Cursor Tracking and Chat to be designed by me.


### What is this?

Type your markdown into the box on the left and immediately see if on the box on the right. If you send a friend a link to this URL you both can edit the document at the same time!
